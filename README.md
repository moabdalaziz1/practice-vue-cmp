## This is a small VUEJS Project To Practice Vue-components communication
# In This Project I Practiced The Following Topics:
- Components Communication
- Working With Dynamic Components with the built-in component in vue called (component)
- Practice this.$emit to emit a custom  event to the component parent.
- Practice providing + injecting options to provide data, methods, etc., and use them with the provided properties at any child of the component.
- I used the <keep-alive></keep-alive> built-in component to cache the state of this component's children.
-  I used the <teleport to="any place in the dom"></teleport> built-in component that helped me organize the dom structure because it can place its child element at any place in the dom using the [to] property.
-  I used this.$refs to access the value of the inputs.
-  I practice the default and named slots and how to add default content to the slot if it is not provided.
-  Finally, I practice the v-for / v-if and some best practices to organize the code, files, and folders.
